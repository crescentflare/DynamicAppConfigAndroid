# DynamicAppConfigAndroid

A useful library to support multiple build configurations or global settings in one application build.


### Integration guide
When using gradle, the library can easily be imported into the build.gradle file of your project. Add the following dependency:

    compile 'com.crescentflare.appconfig:AppConfigLib:1.1.0'

Make sure that jcenter is added as a repository.


### Status

This library has moved [here](https://github.com/crescentflare/DynamicAppConfig). The new DynamicAppConfig repository continues development and includes iOS support.
